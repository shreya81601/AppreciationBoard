# Optional: GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
# This is an alternative to using npm run deploy locally
#
# To use this:
# 1. Uncomment the code below
# 2. Push to main branch
# 3. GitHub will automatically build and deploy to gh-pages
#
# Note: You still need to configure Firebase manually in src/firebase.js
